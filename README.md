## Project deployment:

First of all you need to fork this repository into your GitHub account.
<br>Then setup all the necessary secrets in your newly created fork-repository:

```bash
# GitHub repository -> Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions:
# create all secrets which are needed for CI/CD to access your host server, DockerHub and GitHub
DOCKER_PASSWORD
DOCKER_USERNAME
HOST
SSH_KEY
SSH_PASSPHRASE
USER
TELEGRAM_TO
TELEGRAM_TOKEN
```

Then login to your host server and install all necessary components:
```bash
# username - your username to access Virtual Machine (VM) on host server, ip - ip-address of your VM working under Linux.
ssh username@ip
```

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt install curl -y
```

```bash
sudo curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh && sudo sh get-docker.sh && sudo rm get-docker.sh
```

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker.service && sudo systemctl enable docker.service
```

When all components are successfully installed, you need to create directory **/foodgram** in your home directory **/home/username/** on your VM:

```bash
cd ~
```

```bash
mkdir foodgram
```

The next step is to create file **.env** in directory **/foodgram/**:

```bash
touch .env
```

This .env file needs to be filled with your variables needed for backend and database containers:

```python
POSTGRES_USER=foodgram_user # username for PostgreSQL database
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=foodgram_password # password for PostgreSQL database
POSTGRES_DB=foodgram # name for PostgreSQL database
DB_HOST=db # hostname for PostgreSQL database
DB_PORT=5432 # port PostgreSQL database
SECRET_KEY='your_secret_key' # Django secret key
ALLOWED_HOSTS=11.111.111.11,some.domain.org,127.0.0.1,localhost # Your VM host URL and IP address
DEBUG=True # Django debug setting flag
```
Example .env file can be found in the project root directory: [.env.example](https://github.com/kopf8/foodgram/blob/main/.env.example)

Initial setup is done.
After that you can clone your repository to your local machine via SSH link using the following command in your terminal: 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:username/foodgram.git # <username> is your GitHub username 
```

After you finished working with the code, commit & push all changes to your GitHub repository.
Project CI/CD procedure will automatically deploy all changes to your remote VM using GitHub Actions workflow.
You will receive a message in Telegram once deployment is successfully finished.

## Project documentation
Documentation can be accessed via the following link after deployment:

```url
http://<your.server.address>/api/docs/
```
